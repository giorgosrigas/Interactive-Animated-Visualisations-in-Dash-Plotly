# Interactive-Animated-Visualisations-in-Dash-Plotly

1.	All the libraries required for running my code are: numpy, pandas, pycountry, plotly.express, plotly.io, dash, dash_core_components, dash_html_components, dash.dependencies, dash.exceptions, dash_bootstrap_components, statsmodels. 

2.	I used Dash framework for my interactive elements which is currently not supported by Jupyter notebook or lab. I worked on Pycharm IDE,but it can run in any IDE except Jupyter.

3.	Dash is an open source and its apps run in the web browser so the when you run my code for each of the three py.files, the output will generate http servers, which you have to click in order to see and interact with my visualizations.

For first visualization.py,  the output will generate Running on http://127.0.0.1:844/
For second visualization.py,  the output will generate Running on http://127.0.0.1:8011/
For third visualization.py,  the output will generate Running on Running on http://127.0.0.1:8019/

4.	On all my results I get the warning below:
             “* Serving Flask app (lazy loading)
               * Environment: production
              WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production       deployment.
              Use a production WSGI server instead.”

However, it is just a warning that generates in most dash apps and does not affect the result output in any way.
